####DESCRIPTION

Coffee's not hot enough? Welcome to Hollywood!

Introducting Gossip Hollywood Gurl! This is a site to share your assistant job happenings in the entertainment industry! (but we all know that you're still an unpaid intern). 

Create a profile and post your horrific stories to share with the world and other users in your industry. You may find another post of your boss from a past job that may give you infinite joy. Maybe add a comment to that post to just affirm how bad the person is (or nice ☺️)!

###APPROACH TAKEN
Started with creating the wireframe, ERD, and trello board to help organize and kick off my project. I will then generate the necessary rails MVC for the User and Post MVP. Once completed I will continue onto my stretch goals of commenting on posts and adding a Boss database.
